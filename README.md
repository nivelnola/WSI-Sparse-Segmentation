# Sparse Segmentation for Pathology Images

This repository contains code accompanying the thesis:  
**"Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation of Histopathological Whole Slide Images by Means of Sparse Dictionary Learning"**

## Project Overview

This work presents an unsupervised segmentation algorithm for histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), using sparse representation theory and dictionary learning to generate interpretable, feature-based annotations. The approach aims to enhance algorithmic transparency and reduce dependence on manually labeled training data, compared to conventional deep learning methods.
